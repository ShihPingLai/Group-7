Project:Brownian motion

Purpose:simlate the trajectory of particale in fluid medium and try to describe this experiment in an animation and introduce the model to the stock market prediction

Step:
1. build up a program to simulate an original model of Brownian motion
2. then apply our model on the finanial objects such as stocks, options and bonds
